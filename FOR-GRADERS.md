Hello TAs and Bob!

So I'm pretty sure I've got all the stories done, except that I'm having issues with my form event listener. Somehow my if/else statement starting on line 65 is looping. It works great the first time then is somehow still reading old answers for all future clicked tiles.  I spent enough time on it and am calling it quits for now. 

Because the board is buggy, I didn't mess around with Double Jeopardy, as I didn't want to spend time modifying Round 1's code until it's no longer buggy. So for now, when the round timer runs out it goes straight to Final Jeopardy. And if you don't get kicked over there by the timer, you can click to it (via Double Jeopardy link, then to Final Jeopardy).

Another thing is players can infinitely Pass on a tile. Haven't worked that one out yet tho it doesn't seem to explicitly be a story.
